# Pale Luna

 Loose recreation of early 2010's creepypasta video game written in Python
 
 Summary:
 Pale Luna was an early 2010's creepypasta regarding a supposed text adventure game (in the vein of Zork) 
 never released outside of Northern California and lost in time past the 1980's. Long story short, the game's developer had murdered someone
 and inserted the coordinates of where they buried them inside Pale Luna. 

 The Game Itself:
 This version is based on an earlier z-code recreation released some time ago. While that version aims to stick as close to the story as 
 much as possible, I took some artistic liberties owing to my inexperience as a programmer.
 
 - The game will no longer crash if the wrong direction is inputted on the path. However, as an extra challenge, the path is now pseudo-randomly
   generated. 
   
 - A notepad is added into the game to assist in keeping track of where you're going.

 - The narrative is now different.
